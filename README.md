roject Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for our base CubeSat project. The project focuses
on the foundation for each following payload mission. We encompass the neccessary firmware instrumentation
with the 'Astreus' board, that houses majority of the modern sensors found in cube satellites. 

Key Features:

    Automated Satellite Control: Implementing control algorithms for stability and attitude adjustment.
    Embedded Systems: Hardware and software integration for satellite communication.
    Software: Developing tools for data analysis, simulations, and mission planning.
    Collaboration: Working with industry partners and other academic institutions to extend learning opportunities.
